# track-guard.sh — PreToolUse guard for the executing-parallel-tracks skill.
#
# Makes two of the skill's gates MECHANICAL instead of prompt-trusted:
#   1. Deny-by-default file ownership (per worktree) + frozen entrypoints.
#   2. Worker push/merge lockout — workers stop at `gh pr create --draft`.
#
# Wiring: copy this file + the bundled track-hooks.json into the repo's
# .github/hooks/ directory (the JSON points VS Code / Copilot CLI / cloud agent
# at this script).
# Requires: jq. Keep runtime < 5s — hooks block the agent synchronously.
#
# Per-worktree scope (export BEFORE launching each worker):
#   TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES  colon-separated workspace-relative path prefixes this
#                           track may edit, e.g.
#                           "internal/ingest:migrations/0007_:test/ingest"
#   TRACK_FROZEN_PATHS      colon-separated exact files no track may edit, e.g.
#                           "cmd/main.go:internal/app/app.go"
#   TRACK_IMMUTABLE_PREFIXES  (optional) colon-separated prefixes whose
#                           already-committed files are append-only, e.g.
#                           "migrations/:backend-go/migrations/". A NEW file under
#                           the prefix is fine; editing one with git history is denied.
#
# Always-on (no env needed): any file whose first 3 lines carry a
# "GENERATED — DO NOT EDIT" banner is denied — re-run its generator instead.
#
# Opt-in destructive-infra guard (off unless set):
#   TRACK_GUARD_DESTRUCTIVE  set to any value to also deny irreversible data/infra
#                            shell commands (DROP/TRUNCATE, unbounded DELETE, Redis
#                            FLUSHALL/FLUSHDB, NATS stream/consumer teardown,
#                            rm -rf on an absolute/home path). Tune per stack.
#
# Opt-in fast-forward push (off unless set):
#   TRACK_ALLOW_FF_PUSH      set to any value to permit a plain `git push` (e.g. a
#                            PR-rework flow updating an existing PR branch). --force,
#                            --no-verify, gh pr merge, git merge, and reset --hard
#                            stay denied, so only a fast-forward push is allowed.
#
# NOTE: VS Code ignores hook "matchers", so this script fires on EVERY tool call
# and branches on tool_name itself. Tool names / input keys differ across
# surfaces — VS Code: create_file / replace_string_in_file, camelCase
# tool_input.filePath; Claude/CLI: Write / Edit, snake_case file_path. Both are
# handled below.
set -eufo pipefail   # -f: no globbing (path prefixes are literal, never patterns)

# Bootstrap: load hook presets sitting beside this script, if present:
#   1. track-env.sh       per-worktree LOCAL overrides (gitignored, optional)
#   2. track-env.base.sh  repo-wide COMMITTED defaults (travels into every worktree)
# Local is sourced first so a worktree value wins over the repo base; every line
# uses ${VAR:-default}, so an already-exported value (e.g. an executing-parallel-
# tracks per-track override) still wins over both. No-op when a file is absent.
