# track-evidence-gate.sh — Stop: the closing evidence assertion ("missing rows = not
# done"). Mechanizes verification-before-completion so a done-claim cannot land with
# stale, failed, or missing evidence.
#
# Blocks the stop unless EVERY required pack kind has, in runs/<RUN_ID>.json:
#   1. an evidence entry of that kind (recorded by track-evidence.sh), AND
#   2. whose fingerprint equals the CURRENT worktree fingerprint (not a stale green
#      run captured before later edits), AND
#   3. whose recorded response shows no failure marker.
# Any missing / stale / failed kind -> {decision:"block", reason} listing exactly which.
#
# Opt-in (no-op unless a required source is declared); honors stop_hook_active so it
# can't loop. The required-kind set is the UNION of:
#   TRACK_REQUIRED_EVIDENCE  comma-separated kinds ALWAYS required (the floor), e.g.
#                            "go-test". Labels must match TRACK_EVIDENCE_KINDS.
#   TRACK_EVIDENCE_RULES     ';'-separated glob:kind pairs that make a kind required
#                            ONLY when the branch's diff touches a matching path, e.g.
#                            "migrations/*:pg-explain;*.tsx:ts;*.go:go-test;*.py:py".
#                            This is how different tasks demand different evidence: a
#                            frontend-only change requires `ts`, never `pg-explain`.
#                            Globs are shell patterns where `*` spans `/` (a leading
#                            "**/" is tolerated). Rules are repo-supplied, not baked in.
#   TRACK_BASE_REF           (optional) base to diff against for "what changed" (e.g.
#                            main / origin/main). Falls back to the branch upstream,
#                            then to working-tree changes vs HEAD only.
#   RUN_ID / RUNS_DIR        locate the run record (default RUNS_DIR: runs)
#   TRACK_FAIL_PATTERN       (optional) ERE marking a failed response. Default is
#                            generic; repos add stack-specific markers (Seq Scan on a
#                            big table, TTL of -1, AckPolicy: None) via this override.
#
# If the resulting required set is empty (e.g. a docs-only diff under rule-only mode),
# the gate is a no-op. NOTE: requirement selection is mechanical glob-matching on
# touched paths against pre-authored rules — there is no model call in the gate.
#
# ACCURACY: tool_response is textual, not an exit code, so pass-detection is heuristic.
# CI stays the authoritative gate; this only stops a self-evidently bad claim.
# Requires: jq, git. Keep runtime < 5s — hooks block the agent synchronously.
