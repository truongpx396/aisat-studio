# track-sentinel.sh — Stop: last mechanical scan of the STAGED diff before a worker
# hands off. If it spots a likely secret or a debug leftover, it BLOCKS the stop so
# the agent cleans up before the draft PR — these never reach review.
#
# Opt-in (no-op unless enabled); honors stop_hook_active so it can't loop forever.
#   TRACK_SENTINEL          set to any value to enable the scan
#   TRACK_SECRET_PATTERN    (optional) override the secret-detection ERE
#   TRACK_LEFTOVER_PATTERN  (optional) override the debug-leftover ERE
#
# Blocks via Stop {decision:"block", reason} — the agent receives `reason` and keeps
# working. Scans only ADDED lines of `git diff --cached` (what's actually staged).
# Requires: jq, git. Keep runtime < 5s — hooks block the agent synchronously.
