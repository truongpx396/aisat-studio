# Executing Parallel Tracks

Portable orchestration for running N independent implementation tracks concurrently. This skill is
the **conductor**: it owns isolation, gates, traceability, and integration sequencing, and delegates
the per-track implement/review/verify work to `single-branch-development`. All project-specific facts
(which tasks belong to which track, file ownership, build commands, concurrency cap) live in a
per-repo `track-manifest.md` that this skill reads — never hardcode them here.

**Core mental model:** a **fan-out → isolate → verify → PR → observe** pipeline. *You are the
ceiling.* Parallelism is cheap; your review bandwidth and your ability to trace a failure is the
bottleneck. So the whole design exists to make each parallel worker **independently traceable**
(one run-id across branch, PR, commit trailer, and run record) and **independently revertible** (one
worktree, one branch, one draft PR).

**This skill is the asset; the orchestrator is a runtime role.** Any session can play orchestrator by
invoking this skill — the durable logic lives here, the live state (which worktrees are running,
budget remaining, run registry) lives in the session executing it.

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "execute track 1, track 2, track 3" / "run these tracks in parallel" / "fan out the stories".
- Several work-streams are mutually independent (disjoint files, non-overlapping migrations) and can progress at once.
- You want each track to run autonomously: implement → review → verify → open PR, with no human between tasks.
- A repo has a `track-manifest.md` (or an equivalent dispatch/tasks document) defining the tracks.

Do **not** use this for tightly-coupled tasks that share mutable files — run those serially with
`single-branch-development` instead.

## Prerequisites

- `git` with worktree support; a remote configured for PRs (`gh` CLI authenticated for `gh pr create`).
- Docker available if tracks run integration suites (Testcontainers).
- A repo `track-manifest.md` resolved (see [Manifest contract](#manifest-contract)). If absent, generate one from the repo's tasks/dispatch doc and confirm with the user before proceeding.
- These skills installed and composable: `using-git-worktrees`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `single-branch-development`.
- *(Optional but recommended)* `jq` available and Copilot [agent hooks](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/hooks) enabled, to make the gates mechanical rather than prompt-trusted (see [Deterministic enforcement via Copilot agent hooks](#deterministic-enforcement-via-copilot-agent-hooks)). Hooks may be disabled by enterprise policy — fall back to prompt-enforced gates if so.

## Autonomy boundary (read first)

Autonomous up to and including **opening a DRAFT PR**. The worker's job ends at `gh pr create
--draft`; **GitHub Actions CI is the mechanical gate** (evidence, not claims). Merging is NOT the
worker's job — climb the [maturity ladder](#maturity-ladder-dont-start-at-the-top) deliberately. A
green draft PR proves a track in isolation; only the post-merge tree proves the default branch.
Force-merging several PRs back-to-back is exactly the "never-tested main" failure this skill avoids.

Three gates are mandatory:
1. **Precheck gate** — validate before spawning; ask the human back ONLY if a check fails.
2. **Verifier gate (maker/checker split)** — a DISTINCT adversarial subagent verifies; a failed verifier writes a run record and does NOT open a PR.
3. **Merge gate** — workers stop at "draft PR + evidence + rebased if bounced"; CI gates it; a human or merge queue merges per the maturity rung.

Where a gate is a *mechanical* property (a path, a forbidden command, a counter), enforce it with a [Copilot agent hook](#deterministic-enforcement-via-copilot-agent-hooks) so the worker physically cannot cross it — don't rely on the model obeying a prompt.

## Manifest contract

The skill reads a `track-manifest.md` providing, per repo:

- **tracks**: id → { branch name, worktree path, task IDs, migration/number range it owns }.
- **ownership map**: shared files and who may touch them (append-only hotspots, frozen entrypoints).
- **commands**: lint, unit test, integration test, e2e, dep-lock regen (e.g. `go mod tidy`, `uv lock`).
- **isolation**: per-track Docker project-name / DB namespace convention.
- **caps**: max concurrent tracks running integration suites on this host.
- **invariants**: project release-blockers to assert in review (e.g. access-control deny-by-default).

If a needed field is missing, ask the user once for that specific value; do not guess.

## Traceability: run-id + run records (the spine)

With N workers in flight, durable state is non-negotiable — the model forgets, the file doesn't.

**One run-id, four surfaces.** Mint a stable run-id per track at dispatch
(`<UTC-timestamp>_<track_id>`, e.g. `2026-06-26T14-03_us1`) and stamp it into ALL of:
- the branch name (`track/us1` … keep the run-id in the record if the branch name is fixed),
- the draft PR title (`track/us1 [run 2026-06-26T14-03_us1]`),
- a commit trailer (`Run-Id: 2026-06-26T14-03_us1`),
- the run record filename.

Grep any one surface → reconstruct the whole run.

**Write each track's `goal` as a contract, not a wish.** The `goal` field below is the acceptance
test the worker must pass before it may claim `success` — spell out four things so "done" means
something gradable: the **end state** ("US1 ingest pipeline green per contracts", not "improve
ingest"), the **evidence** required ("integration suite exits 0, output pasted"), the **constraints**
that must hold ("do not edit frozen entrypoints; do not delete existing tests"), and the **budget**
(the hard stops below). A goal with no evidence to fail against will always think it succeeded.

**Run record (one per track, git-ignored `runs/` dir).** Each worker writes/updates
`runs/<run-id>.json` — this is the trace anchor and the orchestrator's memory between ticks:
```json
{
  "run_id": "2026-06-26T14-03_us1",
  "track": "us1",
  "branch": "track/us1",
  "goal": "US1 ingest pipeline green per contracts",
  "status": "blocked",          // success | blocked | no-progress | budget-exceeded
  "evidence": { "lint": "clean", "unit": "42 passed", "integration": "exit 1", "e2e": "n/a" },
  "iterations": 12,
  "tokens": 48000,
  "cost_usd": 0.91,
  "blocker": "flaky Testcontainers Postgres startup",
  "next_step": "pin image tag; retry integration",
  "pr_url": null,
  "trace": [
    { "t": "2026-06-26T14-03-11Z", "kind": "skill",    "name": "using-git-worktrees" },
    { "t": "2026-06-26T14-03-40Z", "kind": "skill",    "name": "test-driven-development" },
    { "t": "2026-06-26T14-05-02Z", "kind": "subagent", "name": "implementer",  "task": "T038" },
    { "t": "2026-06-26T14-09-18Z", "kind": "subagent", "name": "spec-reviewer", "task": "T038" },
    { "t": "2026-06-26T14-11-05Z", "kind": "subagent", "name": "verifier",      "task": "T038", "result": "fail" }
  ]
}
```
Add `runs/` to `.gitignore`. The orchestrator aggregates all records into `runs/summary.md` for review.

**Activation trace.** `trace` is an append-only event log the worker writes one line to **every time**
it invokes a skill or spawns a subagent — giving a readable `skill A → skill B → subagent X → …`
flow for that run. Keep each entry tiny (timestamp, `kind` = skill|subagent, `name`, optional `task`
and `result`). This is the cheap middle layer between the one-line `blocker` and the full session
transcript: enough to see *which step* the worker was in when it failed, without reading every turn.

## Hard stops (enforced by the orchestrator)

The #1 protection against runaway cost with N workers in flight. Enforce all four:
- **Max iterations** per worker (default 25 turns) → halt, `status: no-progress` if exceeded.
- **No-progress detection** — if the verifier result hasn't moved in N passes (default 3), halt that worker `no-progress`. (Distinct from the self-heal cap, which counts *fix attempts*; this counts *stalled passes*.)
- **Per-worker token/\$ ceiling** → halt, `status: budget-exceeded`.
- **Global token/\$ ceiling across ALL workers** → at N>1 this matters more than any single cap; halt the fleet when hit.

## Terminal states (name them explicitly)

Blocked/exhausted runs are NOT successes — workers love to dress them up as done. Every run ends in
exactly one of:
- **success** — verifier passed, evidence pasted, draft PR opened.
- **blocked** — a dependency/bug the worker can't resolve within the self-heal cap.
- **no-progress** — max-iterations or no-progress detector tripped.
- **budget-exceeded** — per-worker or global ceiling hit.

Only `success` opens a PR. The other three write a run record and route to the orchestrator.

## Deterministic enforcement via Copilot agent hooks

The per-branch gates become **mechanical** through Copilot
[agent hooks](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/hooks) — shell commands that run
at lifecycle points (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`) and can
**block a tool call before it happens**. The hook bundle —
[`scripts/track-*.sh`](../single-branch-development/scripts/) and
[`track-hooks.json`](../single-branch-development/templates/track-hooks.json) — is **owned and
documented by `single-branch-development`** (see its *Hooks* section for what each script enforces,
the per-event wiring, and the install steps). This orchestrator reuses that *identical* bundle and
adds only the **parallel-only configuration**: a *different* `TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES` per worktree,
shared frozen entrypoints, and a fleet-wide tool-call ceiling.

Wire a gate to a hook only when it is a *mechanical* property (a path, a forbidden command, a
counter). Leave *judgement* gates — TDD ordering, the maker/checker split, review quality — as
prompt instructions; a hook cannot tell which subagent reasoned about something, nor whether the
*right* suite ran.

Resolve each worker's env **two-tier** before launch — **per-track** vars (`TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES`,
`RUN_ID`) from the track's `Tracks` row, **global** vars from the manifest
Defaults/Commands/Hard-stops sections. Every value is **derived from a `track-manifest.md` field**
(see its *Hook environment* table), not invented:
```bash
# PER-TRACK (a DIFFERENT value in each worktree — export inside each worker's launch)
export TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES="internal/ingest:migrations/0007_:test/ingest"  # this track's owns_paths + owns_migrations
export RUN_ID="2026-06-27T14-03_us1"                                          # <UTC-timestamp>_<track_id>
# GLOBAL (identical for every worker in the wave)
export TRACK_FROZEN_PATHS="cmd/main.go:internal/app/app.go"  # guard: frozen entrypoints
export RUNS_DIR="runs"                                       # one shared dir; RUN_ID keys the file
# OPTIONAL — global; each stays off until set
export TRACK_TEST_CMD_PATTERN="go test|uv run pytest|npm (run )?test"  # evidence
export TRACK_MAX_TOOL_CALLS=200                                       # hard stop
export TRACK_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."     # notify
```
Per-track `TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES` values must be **non-overlapping** across tracks — the
precheck gate already asserts this (overlap → STOP, it would only become a merge conflict).

**Hooks are defense-in-depth, not the final gate.** They are local and bypassable — the
agent can edit a hook script during its own run, and enterprise policy can disable hooks
entirely. Layer them: hooks (fast, in-session) → git `pre-push` (local backstop) →
**GitHub Actions (the unbypassable merge gate)**. CI stays the authority, exactly as the
[autonomy boundary](#autonomy-boundary-read-first) states.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Precheck gate (ask-back only on failure)

Run all checks; proceed silently if all pass, else stop and ask the human with the specific failure:

- Working tree clean (`git status --porcelain` empty) and on the intended base branch.
- `track-manifest.md` resolved and every requested track id exists in it.
- Requested tracks have **non-overlapping** file ownership and migration ranges (cross-check the ownership map). Overlap → STOP, report the collision (it would only become a merge conflict later anyway). Make this mechanical with the bundled [`scripts/track-precheck.sh`](scripts/track-precheck.sh): pipe it a JSON array of `{id, prefixes}` (each track's `TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES`) and it exits non-zero with the exact colliding prefix pair — the same string-prefix rule the guard enforces, so the precheck asserts on precisely what the workers will run.
- Docker/host headroom ≥ requested concurrent tracks vs. the manifest cap. Over cap → propose reducing concurrency.
- `gh` authenticated; remote reachable. `runs/` exists and is git-ignored.
- Mint a run-id per requested track now (`<UTC-timestamp>_<track_id>`).
- **Smoke ONE track end-to-end before fanning out the rest.** Run the first track through the full
  pipeline (implement → verify → draft PR) as a single worker and watch it. The first real run
  almost always exposes a missing check, a fuzzy ownership boundary, or a stop condition that needs
  sharpening — far cheaper to catch on one track than to discover it replicated across N runaway
  workers. Fan out the remaining tracks only after the smoke track reaches a clean `success`.

### 2. Create isolation (one per track)

Use `using-git-worktrees`. For each track from the manifest:
```bash
git worktree add <worktree_path> -b <branch>     # e.g. ../repo-us1 -b track/us1
```
Export the manifest's per-track Docker/DB namespace before any integration run (e.g.
`export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<repo>_us1`). Never point two tracks at one shared dev DB.

### 3. Fan out (one autonomous worker per track)

Use `dispatching-parallel-agents` to launch one worker per track. Each worker executes
`single-branch-development` **inside its own worktree only** for the per-branch pipeline (TDD,
two-stage review, evidence, and draft PR handoff).

Pass each worker: run-id, task IDs, file-ownership scope, manifest commands, and project invariants.
If bundled hooks are enabled, resolve each worker's env two-tier before launch (per-track +
global) exactly as [Deterministic enforcement](#deterministic-enforcement-via-copilot-agent-hooks)
describes.

This orchestrator then applies the stricter parallel-only overlays:

- **Distinct adversarial verifier required** — maker/checker must be a different subagent from the authoring worker; failed verifier -> run record + no PR.
- **Draft-only, no-merge worker boundary** — workers may open draft PRs only; merge remains the merge gate's job.
- **Run-id spine required** — run record + PR title/body + commit trailer stay trace-linked.
- **Fleet controls required** — enforce concurrency cap, no-progress detector, and global budget ceiling across workers.

### 4. Per-track finish → DRAFT PR (autonomous, success only)

Only a `success` run reaches this step. The worker opens a **draft** PR as the final step of
`single-branch-development`:
```bash
gh pr create --draft \
  --title "track/<id> [run <run-id>]" \
  --body "$(cat runs/<run-id>/handoff.md)" \
  --label agent-generated
```
The PR body carries the run-id, the goal contract, and the pasted evidence (test output, cost) — the
trace anchor linking PR ↔ run record. The worker stops here; **CI is the real gate**.

### 5. Integration (merge gate — per the maturity rung, NOT the worker)

Workers never merge. Integration is serialized and chosen by your current
[maturity rung](#maturity-ladder-dont-start-at-the-top):
- **Default (start here):** a human reviews each green draft PR and merges; CI must be green first.
- **Graduated:** a merge queue integrates one at a time — rebase on default branch → **regenerate**
  lockfiles (`go mod tidy` / `uv lock`, never hand-merge) → full suite on the rebased tree → merge
  only if green. Never merge stacked PRs back-to-back without re-running the suite on each rebased tree.

After a track's PR merges, tear down its isolation (`git worktree remove <path>` + delete the merged
branch) so worktrees and per-track Docker namespaces don't accumulate across waves.
### 6. Stale-PR bounce (autonomous, to the owning worker)

When merging one PR makes another stale, do NOT hand-fix. Re-dispatch the owning worker:
```
Rebase track/<id> on origin/<default>; regenerate lockfiles (do NOT hand-merge); rerun the FULL
suite and paste output; force-push. If a SOURCE (non-lockfile) conflict remains, resolve preserving
both behaviors and explain it in the PR.
```

### 7. Report

Aggregate every `runs/<run-id>.json` into `runs/summary.md`. Per track report: terminal state
(success / blocked / no-progress / budget-exceeded), evidence pointer, draft-PR URL, iterations, and
cost. Do not claim success without the evidence having been produced. Blocked/exhausted runs are
reported as such — never dressed up as done.

## Maturity ladder (don't start at the top)

Start low; graduate only after weeks of clean runs.

| Rung | Setup | Your job |
|---|---|---|
| **Start here** | Workers open **draft** PRs in worktrees; CI gates them | Review + merge every PR |
| **Next** | A verifier subagent pre-screens before you see it | Approve the pre-filtered ones |
| **Only after sustained clean runs** | Auto-merge **low-risk classes only** (lint, dep bumps) on green CI; merge queue serializes | Audit the run log, not each diff |

## Gotchas

- **Never auto-merge from a worker.** Workers stop at draft PR; merging follows the maturity rung. Violating this reintroduces the never-tested-main risk.
- **A failed verifier never opens a PR.** It writes `status: blocked` (or no-progress/budget-exceeded) + the blocker to the run record; the orchestrator re-dispatches with the blocker as new context or escalates.
- **Lockfiles are derived** — regenerate, never hand-merge. The most common "conflict" is a no-op script, not a real merge.
- **Frozen entrypoints** (`main.go` / `app.py`) must iterate a module registry; tracks self-register via their own files. Editing the entrypoint per track guarantees merge conflicts.
- **Global budget > per-agent budget at N>1** — one runaway worker is cheap; ten are not. Enforce the fleet ceiling.
- **Human review of MERGED code never leaves the loop** — no matter how good the adversarial verifier gets, "done" is still a claim, not a proof, and comprehension debt grows faster the more the fleet ships code you didn't write. The verifier gate lets you approve faster; it does not let you stop reading what landed on the default branch.
- **Prefer CLIs over heavy MCP servers inside workers** — a single broad MCP can burn ~20k+ tokens of a worker's context before it does any work, and context bloat is a top cause of quality decay and cost blowups over a long run. Give workers named CLIs (self-documenting via `--help`, ~zero context) and reserve MCP for tools with no CLI equivalent.
- **Cap concurrency to the manifest value** — Docker resource exhaustion shows up as flaky timeouts, misread as logic bugs.
- **Overlapping ownership is a precheck failure, not a runtime surprise** — catch it in Step 1.
- **Evidence, not assertion** — "all green" without pasted output is `NEEDS_CONTEXT`. The single most important gate.
- **The run-id is the trace** — if it isn't in the branch/PR/commit/record, the run is untraceable. Stamp all four.
- **VS Code ignores hook matchers** — a `PreToolUse` hook fires on EVERY tool call; branch on `tool_name` inside the script, never rely on a `"Edit|Write"` matcher to scope it.
- **Tool names and input keys differ across surfaces** — VS Code uses `create_file`/`replace_string_in_file` with camelCase `tool_input.filePath`; Claude/CLI use `Write`/`Edit` with snake_case `file_path`. A portable guard script checks both ([`track-guard.sh`](../single-branch-development/scripts/track-guard.sh) does).
- **The agent can edit hook scripts** — set `chat.tools.edits.autoApprove` to disallow editing hook scripts, or a worker can neutralize its own guard mid-run. Keep hooks < 5s; they block the agent synchronously.

## Troubleshooting

- *Two tracks edited the same file* → ownership map was wrong; treat as a merge conflict at integration, bounce to the owning worker, and tighten the manifest so the shared file becomes append-only or frozen.
- *Integration suite flaky under parallel load* → reduce concurrent tracks below the cap; confirm per-track Docker namespaces are distinct.
- *Worker loops on a failing test* → self-heal cap exceeded; escalate `BLOCKED` with root-cause, do not keep retrying.
- *PR green but post-merge main red* → a cross-track interaction the merge queue should have caught; ensure the queue runs the FULL suite on the rebased tree, not just the PR's own subset.
