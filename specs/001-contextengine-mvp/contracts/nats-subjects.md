# Contract: NATS Subject Schema

**Plan**: [../plan.md](../plan.md) | The async seam between the Go BFF (publisher) and Python workers (consumers). Every message carries a `trace_id` (UUID) for Langfuse correlation and the security context resolved server-side (never from the client body).

## Subjects

| Subject | Publisher | Consumer | Payload (key fields) |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| `ingestion.pdf.<workspace_id>` | BFF (S3 event) | Ingestion worker (Track A) | `{ doc_id, s3_key, workspace_id, user_id, tenant_id, access_level, scope, trace_id }` |
| `ingestion.docx.<workspace_id>` | BFF (S3 event) | Ingestion worker (Track A) | same as above |
| `ingestion.image.<workspace_id>` | BFF (S3 event) | Ingestion worker (Track B, captioning) | same as above |
| `ingestion.crawl.<workspace_id>` | Note-enrich worker | Ingestion worker (Track D, Crawl4AI) | `{ doc_id, url, workspace_id, user_id, tenant_id, access_level, scope, trace_id }` — **internal** fetch step of note enrichment (no longer a user-facing standalone-link path, FR-001) |
| `enrich.note.<workspace_id>` | BFF (`POST /notes/{id}/enrich`) | Python enrich role | `{ stream_id, note_id, body, source_links[], workspace_id, user_id, effective_access_level, idem_key, trace_id }` — crawls `source_links` (SSRF-guarded), distills against `body`, streams a draft via the SSE relay; draft not persisted until the member accepts (FR-001) |
| `ingestion.audio.<workspace_id>` | BFF (S3 event) | Stub consumer | Returns `501 Not Implemented` (Phase 1 stub, FR-003; Whisper transcription is the Phase 2 implementation) |
| `ingestion.dlq.<workspace_id>` | Ingestion worker | Retry consumer / janitor | Parked chunks (e.g., embed-provider outage) for retry — never re-embedded with a different model (FR-029) |
| `query.agent.<workspace_id>` | BFF (`/query`) | LangGraph worker pool | `{ stream_id, query, workspace_id, user_id, effective_access_level, session_id, intent_hint?, idem_key, trace_id }` |
| `billing.deduct.<workspace_id>` | Python spend producers (query / ingest / agent workers) **or** Redis outbox drain | **Go kernel billing worker** | `{ workspace_id, user_id, cost, operation_type, idem_key, trace_id }` → Go applies the Redis fast-path effect (idempotent) and writes `INSERT INTO credit_ledger`. **Go is the sole `credit_ledger` writer**; Python never writes the ledger — it only publishes the computed spend (SC-006). |
| `billing.grant.<workspace_id>` *(Phase 2)* | BFF (webhook handler, post-verify) | **Go kernel billing worker** | `{ workspace_id, plan_id, credits, operation_type, payment_id, idem_key, trace_id }` → `INSERT INTO credit_ledger` (positive delta) + `UPDATE workspace_credits` + Redis `INCRBY` (idempotent). See [billing-payments-design.md](../billing-payments-design.md) |
| `notify.<workspace_id>` | Any producer (ingestion / billing / invite / agent-run / admin BFF) | Notification service (Go kernel) | `{ recipient_user_id, category, priority, title, body, payload, workspace_id, trace_id }` → applies prefs, persists row, pushes in-app, and (if enabled) republishes to `notify.email.<ws>` (FR-032–FR-035) |
| `notify.email.<workspace_id>` | Notification service | Python email worker | `{ notification_id, recipient_email, category, title, body, workspace_id, trace_id }` → renders + sends via `EmailSender` port (default: Resend, swappable by env) (FR-035) |
| `notify.email.dlq.<workspace_id>` | Email worker | Retry consumer / janitor | Parked email sends after exhausting provider retries — never silently dropped (FR-035) |
| `billing.reconcile.tick` | Scheduler (k8s `CronJob` / DO scheduled component / cron / single-owner `worker` ticker) | Go `cmd/worker` (queue group) | `{ shard, hour_bucket, trace_id }` → one worker runs the hourly Redis↔ledger reconcile for the bucket, guarded by `SET NX reconcile:lock:{shard}:{hour_bucket}` (SC-006, research §15) |
| `agent.janitor.tick` | Scheduler (k8s `CronJob` / DO scheduled component / cron / single-owner `worker` ticker) | Python janitor role (queue group) | `{ trace_id }` → one worker scans stale `agent_run` heartbeats and re-queues via conditional `UPDATE … WHERE status='running' AND last_heartbeat_at < $ RETURNING id` (SC-009, research §15) |
| `usage.matview.refresh` | Scheduler (k8s `CronJob` / DO scheduled component / cron / single-owner `worker` ticker) | Go `cmd/worker` (queue group) | `{ trace_id }` → one worker runs `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY llm_cost_daily` (FR-022, research §15) |

## Rules

- **Transport is JetStream, not core NATS.** Every subject is a JetStream stream; workers consume via **durable pull consumers** bound to a **per-subject queue group**. Crash recovery, DLQ redelivery, and consumer-lag autoscaling all depend on JetStream persistence — core NATS is not used (research §6, §14).
- **Security context is authoritative from the publisher.** Workers never read `workspace_id`/`access_level` from untrusted content; they use the fields stamped by the BFF (FR-004, FR-027).
- **Per-subject scaling.** Workers scale per subject via the queue group (3 pods/subject in Phase 1; KEDA on JetStream consumer lag in Phase 2/4).
- **Scheduled work is externally triggered and single-owner.** The request-serving tiers (`api`/`relay`) run no in-process `time.Ticker`. A pluggable scheduler (k8s `CronJob`, DO App Platform scheduled component, plain `cron`/systemd timer, or a single internal ticker in the one-replica `worker`) publishes the `*.tick` / `*.refresh` events; a **durable queue group delivers each to exactly one worker**, and every handler is an idempotent atomic claim (conditional `UPDATE` / `SET NX` / atomic pop / `REFRESH ... CONCURRENTLY`), so redelivery or replica overlap produces no duplicate effect. Periodic jobs run in the dedicated `cmd/worker` role (Go) or the single-owner janitor role (Python), never in a request-serving tier (research §15).
- **DLQ semantics.** Embedding-provider outages park the chunk in `ingestion.dlq.<ws>` rather than embedding inconsistently; a retry consumer re-attempts with the original model only (FR-029, research §4).
- **Streaming.** Query workers stream partial results via Redis pub/sub keyed by `stream_id` → Go SSE → browser (see [sse-events.md](./sse-events.md)).
- **Single ledger writer (Go).** Postgres `credit_ledger` is written **only** by the Go kernel billing worker (fast-path effect + outbox drain + reconciliation, all in `backend-go/kernel/billing/`). Python spend producers compute cost and **publish** `billing.deduct.<ws>` but never `INSERT` into the ledger or touch the Redis balance — this keeps a single authoritative money-writer behind the kernel and RLS (SC-006).
- **Idempotency.** The Go `billing.deduct` consumer relies on `credit_ledger.idem_key UNIQUE` plus a `SET NX billing:applied:{idem_key}` guard; duplicate events/drains are no-ops (SC-006).
- **Grant idempotency *(Phase 2)*.** The Go `billing.grant` consumer reuses the same `credit_ledger.idem_key UNIQUE` guarantee plus a `SET NX billing:applied:{idem_key}` guard (research §3); a replayed payment webhook inserts one positive ledger row and performs one Redis `INCRBY`. Grants for recurring invoices are keyed by the invoice ID, so out-of-order/duplicated provider deliveries converge (SC-006).
- **Notification fan-out is centralized.** Producers publish a single `notify.<ws>` event with the resolved `recipient_user_id`; only the notification service knows about preferences, persistence, in-app push, and the email channel. `recipient_user_id` and `workspace_id` are authoritative from the publisher, never from untrusted content (FR-036).
- **Email channel is best-effort and isolated.** In-app delivery is never blocked by email; transient email failures retry and park in `notify.email.dlq.<ws>` (FR-035).

## Contract test obligations

- An `ingestion.audio.*` message yields a clear unsupported result, not a silent drop (FR-003).
- A simulated embed-provider outage routes the chunk to `ingestion.dlq.*`, not into Qdrant (FR-029).
- A duplicated `billing.deduct` with the same `idem_key` causes the **Go** billing worker to insert exactly one ledger row; Python never writes the ledger (SC-006).
- *(Phase 2)* A duplicated `billing.grant` with the same `idem_key` inserts one positive ledger row and applies one Redis `INCRBY` (SC-006).
- A `query.agent.*` run honors `effective_access_level` in its payload pre-filter (SC-001).
- A `notify.<ws>` event whose recipient disabled a category's email channel produces an in-app notification but no `notify.email.<ws>` publish (FR-035).
- A simulated email-provider failure routes the send to `notify.email.dlq.<ws>`, and the in-app notification is delivered regardless (FR-035).
- A `*.tick` / `*.refresh` event delivered twice (redelivery or two schedulers) yields exactly one effect — one reconcile per `{shard, hour_bucket}`, one re-queue per stale `agent_run`, one matview refresh (research §15, SC-006, SC-009).
